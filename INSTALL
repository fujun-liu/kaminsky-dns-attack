pacgen v1.10 install file
Bo Cato (pacgen.sourceforge.net)

    1. Make sure you have Libnet installed, pacgen was written with 1.1.2.1
       installed. Goto www.packetfactory.net or somewhere else and get it.

    2. Read the README file

    3. Compile via the libnet-config script (at least this is how I did it):
 
        gcc `libnet-config --cflags --defines` pacgen.c -o pacgen \
        `libnet-config --libs`

    4. Or for the lazy run the install.sh script
